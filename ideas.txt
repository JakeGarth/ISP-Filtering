do number of hops to default DNS, see if it is one. If so, then if there is two hops, there must be a middlebox.
Could set TTL = 1, or TTL = 2 to do so?

IP blocking can be determined if IP address is accessible from another ISP, but not another.

403 errors can be due to cloudflare blocking direct IP access
If public DNS servers IP address varies from ISP to ISP, then, DNS injection is happening, especially if the response code varies

if 451 error, this means that the IP is blocked, and another isp provides a different IP, then you know the 451 is dns blocked

dns injection of public DNS's can be detected if the public DNS IP's are different (e.g. googles dns resolves different ips from different isps)

can't use 403:forbidden errors because sometimes they cloudflare, maybe web-scrape these to determine if cloudflare?

can't determine if it is domain name blocking, because sometimes IP's have been spoofed such that they go to a webpage with "content denied" and return a 200 response code.
